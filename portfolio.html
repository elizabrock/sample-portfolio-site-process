              For a normal student's portfolio, each of the blocks below would represent a single project that they have worked on.
              However, I'm going to use this as a venue for showing how much of a difference each of our design changes make!

                <h2>Markup Only</h2>
                <p>At this point, all we have is mark-up.</p>

                <h2>Markup with some spacing</h2>
                <p>At this point, we will have added a few lines of CSS to let the content breath.</p>

                <p>At this point, we will have created a basic layout for our portfolio.</p>

                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p>Adding some font choices at this point will really bring in some personality!</p>

                <h2>Let It Rest</h2>
                <p>At this point, there are going to be plenty of issues with how this site looks and how garish the colorscheme is.  We'll let it rest for a few hours and then pick it back up again to see how it looks after a rest!</p>
